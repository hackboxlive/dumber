A dumb chatbot that replies sarcastically mostly, as it is trained on Reddit's comment data.

I recently found this post on reddit where all the publicly available comment till 2016 was present.

And I stumbled upon a blog post on how to train a chatbot using tensorflow. I really got interested in it and wanted to create something using that. 
The model that I am using of Tensorflow is sequence-to-sequence model which is an adaptation of Recurrent Neural Networks.

This project is mainly to see how libraries work, and this is my first time dealing with databases. I tried using sqlite3 in python3 to manage the databases. 

I think it was a fun project to make.

**NOTE**

The small `db` files present in the repo are just a small part of the 30 GB database that the chatbot is actually trained on. :-p
